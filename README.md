1. Start a React Native project based on the documentation on the website. You can use expo if you like.
2. Implement a single screen to search for restaurants.
3. Each restaurant entry has at least an image, name of the restaurant, rating and a brief description. You can take some UI inspiration on review cards from existing websites like Zomato, Yelp, Swiggy.
4. Implement the search in a way that on every keystroke, the results get updated, and there are some results even when there is no search string.
5. Make the search cards attractive
6. You can hardcode the data for the app.
